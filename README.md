üëã Looks like you've found my profile! Enjoy your stay (and don't take me too serious ^\_^)!  
üí£ I'm a **reverse engineer** and **software engineer** that mostly dabbles around in **Rust**, **C++** and various **Assembly** languages.  
üëπ I spend most of my free time working on low-level projects such as but not limited to reverse engineering software (malware, anti cheats, games, ...), writing emulators, creating reversing & exploit development related tooling and implementing compiler related programs (usually for obfuscation and/or deobfuscation).  
üïπÔ∏è I retired from playing CTFs after co-founding and playing alongside [organizers](https://ctftime.org/team/42934/) but occasionally help out or look into challenges out of curiosity.  
üîë Most notable credentials are my teams' (through *[2019 excusemewtf](https://ctftime.org/team/104977/)* and *[2020-2022 organizers](https://ctftime.org/team/42934/)*) CTF rankings along with my personal ranking on [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/7533) (retired; peaked at global #2), along with the projects on my GitHub.  
üï∏Ô∏è I infrequently blog about my shenanigans over [on my blog layle.me](https://layle.me).  
‚úâÔ∏è You can contact me either on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/layle_ctf) or on Discord via `mrlayle`.
