* reverse engineer & software engineer (Rust, C++ and Assembly mostly), working as a penetration tester & vulnerability researcher during the day  
* working on low-level projects such as emulators, game-cheats, compilers and exploits. anything low-level really  
* currently learning hardware related topics such as FPGAs  
* used to play tons of CTFs; I founded & co-founded [excusemewtf](https://ctftime.org/team/104977/) (2019) and [organizers](https://ctftime.org/team/42934/) (2020-2022) respectively  
* personal ranking on [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/7533) peaked at global #2  
* sometimes I ramble on my blog over @ [layle.me](https://layle.me)
